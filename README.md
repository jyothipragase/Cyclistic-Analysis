# Cyclistic-Analysis
# How Does a Bike Share Navigate Speedy Success?
In this case study, we will perform many data analyst tasks. We will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, we will follow the steps of the data analysis process.

In this Case Study

- We cleaned Dataset and analyzed using EXCEL and Tableau
- Dropping null values as they were small in numbers
- Swapped start date and end date for rows with start date more than end date
- Checked for duplicates and missing dates
- Created new day of week column, extracted date and travel time by subtracting start and end date
- With latitudes and longitudes we found distance by using formula
- Analyzed top 10 stations for start and end points
- Analyzed same with respect to member categories
- Found that for casual rider Sunday and Saturday, and for annual member Sunday and Thursday are peak days
- And analyzed various other relations like distance and avg distance w.r.t.o. members and dates/dayofweeks
- Visualized some and rest visuals can be seen on my Tableau Public profile below
